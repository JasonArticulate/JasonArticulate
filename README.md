## 👀 About Me

I'm not just about coding; when I'm not developing, you'll often find me gaming on PS4/PS5, exploring virtual worlds and connecting with friends. As a developer, I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, crafting interactive and user-friendly web experiences.

## 🌱 What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm building a 120-short course on Learnworlds tailored for young people, focusing on essential digital skills and personal development. Additionally, within The Articulate Hub project, I'm leading the development of two key features:

- **The Vault**: A secure digital storage space for young people to store important documents and memories.
- **Buddy AI**: An AI-driven support system aimed at providing personalized assistance and guidance to users.

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

- Open-source projects related to youth empowerment
- Initiatives focused on improving digital access and inclusion
- Innovative solutions to address challenges faced by young people with care experience
