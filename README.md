## 👀 About Me

I'm not just about coding; when I'm not developing, you'll often find me gaming on PS4/PS5, exploring virtual worlds, and spending time with my family. As a developer, I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and C++, crafting interactive and user-friendly web experiences and applications.

## 🌱 What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm building a 120-short course on Learnworlds tailored for young people, focusing on essential digital skills and personal development. Additionally, within The Articulate Hub project, I'm leading the development of two key features:

- **The Vault**: A secure digital storage space for young people to store important documents and memories.

- **Buddy AI**: An AI-driven support system aimed at providing personalized assistance and guidance to users.
- **Studio**: A platform for personal storytelling and expression.
